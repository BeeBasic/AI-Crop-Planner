## üèõÔ∏è Architecture and Workflow  
1. **Authentication** ‚Äì Secure Google login with Firebase.  
2. **Location & Data Fetching** ‚Äì React app fetches user latitude & longitude, then calls APIs (OpenWeatherMap + ISRIC SoilGrids).  
3. **Model 1 (Suitability)** ‚Äì XGBoost model predicts **top 3 crops** with confidence scores.  
4. **Model 2 (Profitability)** ‚Äì CatBoost forecasts **90-day future prices** for those crops using mandi data with lag features.  
5. **Dashboard** ‚Äì Renders ranked list of crops with suitability, predicted prices, trend graphs, and government scheme links.  
6. **Chatbot Interaction** ‚Äì Fine-tuned Gemma chatbot served locally and exposed via Cloudflare Tunnel for multilingual farmer queries.
